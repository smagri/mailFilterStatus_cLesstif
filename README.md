* This is an  X GUI application using the  opensoruce Lesstif library.
  It was used  to tell me when  new emails entered the  email client I
  was using at the time, evolution.

Need to port to C++ language and Qt widget library.

However, since I'm not using emacs viewmail, now using evolution, this
tool is  no longer  necessary.  With viewmail  you needed  to manually
enter  a spool  folder  to see  if  new messages  are  there, this  is
annoying in itself  as a few emacs commands are  required, and it also
takes you away from your editing/coding widow.

Humm...maybe find some other use for the algorithim to justify port.

But maybe do just for fun...
